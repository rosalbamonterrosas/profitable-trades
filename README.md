Profitable Trades

This is an application that determines when the most profitable trade will occur for a stock during a month. 

The application reads the file prices.txt, which contains the prices for a stock during a month, and stores the prices in an prices array. The user is notified if the file did not successfully open for reading. 

The program also determines the minimum and maximum number of an array. 

After finding the maximum price in the prices array, the program determines all of the possible profits and stores the profits into a profits array. The profits array is also saved into a file named profits.txt. 

The maximum profit in this profit array is then determined and printed out to the user, along with the entire profit array.
